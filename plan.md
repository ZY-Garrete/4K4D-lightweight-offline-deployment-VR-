# Research Plan
**1. Model 4K4D**
  + Review the 4K4D framework and its related methods
    + 4D point cloud representation 
    + Gaussian splatting
    + differentiable depth peeling
    + ...
  
**2. Datasets**
  + Analyze the dataset: 
    + DNA-Rendering
    + ENeRF-Outdoor
    + ..
  
**3.Code running**
  + EasyVolCap: generate initial dynamic cloud point for 4K4D
    + corresponding the Space Carving Algorithm in the Eassy
